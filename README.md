## Overview
I am Full Stack Developer specializing in programming, with skills in JavaScript, Bootstrap, SQL, and Python. I will be updating my portfolio page frequently.
* [GitHub Portfolio Page](https://orlandocarnate.github.io/)
* [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/orlandocarnate)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orlando-carnate/)

## Portfolio Page Future Development
Future plans are to rebuild profile page with jQuery, Node.js, and React and run it on my own domain and server.

## Site Structure
The site folder consists of the following:
* `index.html` - home and about page
* `portfolio.html` - portfolio page
* `contact.html` - contact form page
* `assets` folder
    * `images` folder
    * `css` folder
        * `reset.css` - if used this resets all the style elements.
        * `style.css` - my custom stylesheet.


### using Git & GitHub
I will be using Git for versioning my files and GitHub uploading them to my repository.

First create a new repository in GitHub and then copy the link.

Then use `git clone <link> <destination_folder>` to download a copy or initialize a new local repository in the destination folder.

Using Git Bash in the project folder:
`git init` to initialize a new local repository
`git add .` to add any or all files and folders that are new or modified.
`git status` to check the staging status.
`git commit -m 'Your Message Here` to commit the record the changes in the repository and adds a comment.
`git push origin master` to upload to an Online repository, in this case, Github.
